						<h2>Greetings!</h2>
						<p>
							Welcome to the webpage for the University of Toronto chapter of the
							<br><b>Cosmic Origins: Explorers Science Interest Group (COR:E SIG)</b>,
							<br>founded by NASA scientist Dr. Ron Gamble and in collaboration with <b>NASA Jet Propulsion Labratory</b>.
							<br>If you are new to this club or are interested in joining, please fill out this <i><a href="https://forms.gle/DUobRGqboe4vsWaQ9">form</a></i>.

							<h2><a href="#">About Our Mission</a></h2>
							<p>
								We aim to provide assistance to all those that wish to navigate the wonderful field of astronomy in their time at UofT.
								No matter your knowledge level, or discipline of study, we hope to provide resources to guide you on your academic and
								 professional journey in astronomy.
							</p>

						<p>
							We are currently in the beginning stages of developing this club. As 4th year undergraduate students, we are familiar with
							the unique struggles of an Astronomy and Astrophysics student. This club was founded to aid students of all disciplines in
							navigating all things astronomy.
							<br><br> Currently, we are in collboration with Dr. Ronald Gamble, a theoretical astrophysicist 
								at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Dr. Gamble started an initiative called the <b>Cosmic Origins: Explorers Science Interest Group
								 (COR:E SIG)</b>, a student focused group that promotes professional development directly with help from NASA experts.
								 Undergrauate and graduate students from universities across Canada and the US can participate in many activities and
								 events that help develop the skills to become successful in the field of astronomy. The Univeristy of Toronto has been
								  selected as one of the schools to participate in the 'pilot' of this group. More information can be found on the
								   <a href=="https://www.theoreticallydrgamble.com/student-opportunities/cosmic-explorers">official website</a>.
							<br><br>
							Additionally, we are also in collaboration with members at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratories, who are working on the revolutionary <b>Habitable Worlds Observatory</b>.
							 They aim to create a program that inspires undergraduate students in the search for life in other planets. Through this program, there will be visiting speakers from
							  NASA, scholarships, mentorships, and eventually networking with other participating universities, culminating in massive outreach events. Along with this, there will
							be a possibility to present for NASA at a conference.
							<br><br>
							Throughout the year, we also plan to create additional workshops to aid Astronomy Majors and Specialists in the massive jump in difficulty between the second year courses
							 (AST221,AST222) and third year courses (AST320,AST325/6). These workshops will mostly help students with programming in astronomy.
							<br><br>
							Finally, for any students interested in modern astrophysics, we will be hosting events that discuss the latest developments in astronomy, primarily in exoplanets.
							 Whether through discussion, newsletters, or even a podcast, we will keep everyone updated on the newest developoents in current research.
